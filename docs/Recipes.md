# ArchiveSpark Recipes

To get common tasks done more quickly, we have prepared a few recipes that you can copy and customize for your needs.
In most cases, all you need to do is to change the paths to locate your data or replace the Data Specification to be used.
More about the provided Data Specifications can be found here: [DataSpecs](DataSpecs.md).

* [Extracting title + text from a selected set of URLs](../notebooks/Selected_Title-and-Text.ipynb)
* [Loading and resolving a dataset that contains revisit records](../notebooks/Resolve_Revisit_Records.ipynb)
* to be extended soon ...

## Interoperability

We have shown that recipes can be reused among different kinds of archival datasets as well as data sources, e.g., Web archives and digital journals.
